Hi, I'm Saksham Dhull ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with experience in research and development on the cutting edge tech. I started my journey at Samsung Research in South Korea, working on the R&D for the 6G technical stack from the ground up. Later, I joined the Language and Voice Team, where I focused on building a multi-modal speech LLM.

Before Samsung, I worked as a software engineer at Spotnana, where I developed a master API that automated code generation from specsâ€”a project that let me dive deep into code automation and API design.

I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2021 with a major in Computer Science. While there, I worked a lot on Machine Learning, Algorithms, Computer Networks and OS.

Outside of work, I love travelling and meeting people from all walks of life. On quieter days, youâ€™ll probably find me gaming at home ðŸŽ®. I'm also into cycling and hikingâ€”especially through challenging terrain. I have cycled a total of 3000 kms and hiked through a lot of himalayas.

I also love spending my spare time volunteeringâ€”whether itâ€™s teaching kids or helping plant trees. Itâ€™s a great way to get a fresh perspective and give back to the community.
